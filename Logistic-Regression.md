# Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is a statistical model that in its basic form uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable. In regression analysis, logistic regression (or logit regression) is estimating the parameters of a logistic model.

## Use Cases

- Example 1
- Example 2

## Implementation

Here's an example of how to implement logistic regression:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Example data
X = np.array([[0, 0], [1, 1], [1, 0]])  # Features
y = np.array([0, 1, 0])  # Labels

# Initialize the Logistic Regression model
model = LogisticRegression()

# Fit the model
model.fit(X, y)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X)
