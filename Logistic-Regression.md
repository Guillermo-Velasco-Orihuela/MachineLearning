# Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is a statistical model that in its basic form uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable. In regression analysis, logistic regression (or logit regression) is estimating the parameters of a logistic model. It is particularly useful for situations where the outcome is binary.

## Fundamental Concepts and Formulas

Logistic regression predicts the probability that a given input belongs to the class labeled "1". The probabilities predicting class "1" are computed with the logistic function, which is defined as:

\[ P(y = 1 | x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}} \]

where \( z \) is the linear combination of the input features \( x \) weighted by the coefficients \( \beta \) derived from the training data:

\[ z = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + \dots + \beta_nx_n \]

The coefficients are estimated using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), which aims to find the parameter values that maximize the likelihood of the observed sample.

## Use Cases

- Example 1: Predicting credit approval based on financial history.
- Example 2: Medical diagnosis prediction, such as determining whether a patient has a particular disease based on observed characteristics.

## Implementation

Here's an example of how to implement logistic regression:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Example data
X = np.array([[0, 0], [1, 1], [1, 0]])  # Features
y = np.array([0, 1, 0])  # Labels

# Initialize the Logistic Regression model
model = LogisticRegression()

# Fit the model
model.fit(X, y)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X)
