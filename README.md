### Classification Models

Classification is a supervised learning task where the goal is to predict the categorical label of a given input based on labeled training data.

Each input is associated with one or more predefined categories or classes, and the objective of the classification algorithm is to assign the correct category to new, unseen inputs.

If there are only 2 possible classifications, it is a binary classification problem. (Think, yes or no)

If there are more than 2 possible classifications, it is a multi-class classification problem.
